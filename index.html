    <h1>Data is electric, isn't it?</h1>
<p>Every day we are surrounded by one of the most important innovations of all time, electricity. Electricity is one of the most important blessings that science has given to mankind. There was a time when people lived without it for centuries in a dark world with just a candle here and there. But due to the progress and development made by man himself, the world was lit and that was the moment everything changed. It not only allowed humans to switch on the lights and be able to cook, study, clean and go about their daily chores but also supported a lot of industries and thus revolutionized the world. In the similar way, Data is changing our lives.   
We know that electricity is distributed through electric distribution substations where the high voltage electricity is channeled through step-down transformers that lower the voltage, the electricity is then transmitted to network of local electric distribution lines to reach our homes. Just the way electricity travels through distribution lines, knowledge gets transferred from one person to the another, or let’s just say, over a network. The network of networks is an inexhaustible source of information. These massive and distinct pieces of information collectively form the data about many aspects of our lives. Shopping, news, communications and conversations, music and movies, opinions and views about things, almost everything becomes data.

  “Data is like sunshine we keep using it, and it keeps regenerating.” 
-Ruth Porat

<p>Data is more than just a four-letter word, more than just code. It helps us grow, produce and generate. We’re in a digital economy where data is more valuable than ever. It’s the key to the smooth functionality of everything from the government to local companies. Without it, we would be nothing but lost in the dark. If we just consider the internet data, we have finance, medicine, social, education, entertainment, retail and the list goes on. All these sectors data are enough to be considered as “Big”. It’s this massiveness that makes it “BIG DATA”. </p>

<p>Big Data is defined using the 3 V’s – volume, variety and velocity. Volume is a major part of Big data. If we remove volume from Big data, then the “Big” doesn’t remain that “Big” enough but turns into a small set of data. Variety makes Big Data really big as it comes from a great variety of sources. It refers to all the structured or unstructured data that gets generated by humans or machines. With Velocity we refer to the speed at which data are being generated. It’s almost like a nuclear data explosion. 
But it doesn’t make just justice to describe big data solely on the basis of these 3 V’s. Data can be vast as well as valid. Vast would be rightful as we already know how “big” the data gathered is. As far as valid is concerned, data is said to be valid if our findings truly represent the phenomenon we are claiming to measure. It’s the truthfulness of the source in respect to the information presented.
</p>
<p>As the world entered the era of Big Data, the need for its storage also grew and it became a main concern. Hadoop and other frameworks solved this problem and now the next question that arose was the processing of this data. That’s where Data Science comes into picture. </p>
<p>
  Data Science has taken the world by storm. Every field of study and area of business has been affected as people increasingly realize the value of the incredible quantities of data being generated. 
Seeing the transformative power of data, we can call it as “electric”. It is more than the data-byte itself as it comes with a lot of value which we extract or unlock. Thus, we can refer to this digital transformation as the fourth industrial revolution with a deep impact on our lives.</p>

How can we secure our data from intruders?
